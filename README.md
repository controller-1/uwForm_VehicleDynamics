# uwForm_VehicleDynamics


'main.m' is the main file and contains a 3DOF vehicle dynamic model utilizing the Pacejka tire model. The model can be used for braking/throttle and steering inputs. 

This model was created specifically for use in validating the longitudinal/lateral controllers of an autonomous FSAE race car. Ideally, the vehicle model would be correlated with track data of the real car before validation of controllers.
