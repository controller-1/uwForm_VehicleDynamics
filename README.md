# uwForm_VehicleDynamics

**Currently under development**

'main_braking_TEST.m' is the main file and contains a 3DOF vehicle dynamic model utilizing the Pacejka tire model. Although the file name contains 'braking', the model can be used for throttle and steering inputs as well. 

This model was created specifically for use in validating the longitudinal/lateral controllers of an autonomous FSAE race car. Ideally, the vehicle model would be correlated with track data of the real car before validation of controllers.
